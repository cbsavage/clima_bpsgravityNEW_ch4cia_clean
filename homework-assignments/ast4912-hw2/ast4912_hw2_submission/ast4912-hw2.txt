Ok, now you are going to learn how to use "if-endif" statements and
"for" loops and learn some real programming techniques.

Write a Fortran program that uses Newton's method to solve the following
function f(x) = x - 0.25*sin(x)+5
I have attached a summary of Newton's Method that explains how the
Newton's method equation (x = xo - f(x)/fprime(x) ) is derived.

You will need to provide an initial "guess" and then iterate until
converging to the solution.

You do this by setting f(x) = 0 and finding the root x that satisfies
that solution. You will also need to find the first derivative, fprime(x).

After each iteration, you will calculate a new value of f(x). You will
use a "for" loop for this calculation.
When f(x) is less than some acceptable error (del), then you have
converged to the solution and found the root x. Let's assume that del =
1.e-11. For this part you would use an "if statement."
I have attached a jpg that explains this in more detail.

I have also attached an "Introduction to Fortran" pdf with more
information.

I hope that helps!


Use your favorite text editor  and create a file with a .f90 extension
to start.


After writing your Fortran code, to run it, you compile it  via:

 >> ifort nameoffile.f90
You will then obtain an output file (a.out)

To execute the program, write
 >> ./a.out

And also do a "do while enddo" version in addition to "do enddo" version.

Finally, always type "Implicit None" at the top of your Fortran codes!
This is good practice and allows you to define your variables rather
than using defaults nobody uses.
