mixing ratios
simulating modern earth



12/6/2023:

Modern Earth Run:
initial input_clima.dat settings:0
	initial steps: 1000
	G: change from Mars to Earth
	RAD: mars to earth
	PO: 5.e-5
	PGO: 3
	IO3, IUP: 0
	TGO: 206
	TSTRAT = 167.
	ICONSERV: 1
	SRFALB: 0.216

cal-earth: initial methane was 1.000E-60
- files in stokes dirs stayed but in my Ubuntu it didn't??
- run in stokes for now
- waiting for dir to download full
- realized that file and directory cannot have same name even with different capitalization???
- 
-- after thing runs, copy temp-out into temp-in in IO/

clima_allout is an output file

clima_last shows temp & vertical profile (plotting stuff)
plot pressure on y-axis

might have to delete & re-upload the zip file :(
(had to do that 12/15/2023)


12/13/2023:

- NO MODEL DEVELOPMENT ONLY IN RESEARCH PROPOSAL
- BETTER PROPOSALS HAVE OBSERVATIONAL AND THEORETICAL ASPECTS


1/31/2024:

- more co2 near surface
- pco2: 5.1875e-4
- 29 g/mol
- co2: 44 g/mol
- '~' at end of name of file says its older version
- when change driver file, do 'make clean'
inner edge @ 200 K

2/14/2024:
- clima_last.tab is best for plotting data
